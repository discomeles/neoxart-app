## It is all about connections

In the modern world of social networks individual pieces of information
mean nothing without connections.

NeoXart is a note taking app aimed at connecting diverse pieces of data, discourses and ideas. Its future purpose is to offer novel insights, with the help of graphical visualization, of all those relations which may be otherwise difficult to recognize. It fulfills the need we have for building an integrated picture of understanding from scattered fragments of knowledge.

## Ongoing development
NeoXart is currently in its early stages of development. 

Next phases will include:
- Building comprehensive editing tools
- Improving UI experience
- Implementing graph database connectivity
- Creating visualization utilities

## NeoXart server
NeoXart app is developed in close connection with [NeoXart server](https://github.com/discomeles/neoxart-server)
